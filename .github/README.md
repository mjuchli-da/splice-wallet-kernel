# CI Test Run Matrix

This document summarizes when each test job in `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs.

## Pull Request Trigger

The CI workflow runs on pull request events:

- `opened`
- `reopened`
- `synchronize`
- `edited`

Required checks should avoid conditional worker jobs as the branch protection checks directly. The workflow uses aggregator wrappers (`test-ping-e2e` and `test-wallet-sdk-e2e`) that always run and validate whether the corresponding conditional worker job had to run and succeeded.

## Conditional E2E Trigger Rules

### `ping-e2e` runs when either condition is true:

- `@canton-network/example-ping` is affected.
- `@canton-network/wallet-gateway-remote` is affected.
- `scripts/src/lib/version-config.json` changes.

### `test-portfolio-e2e` runs when either condition is true:

- `@canton-network/example-portfolio` is affected.
- `@canton-network/wallet-gateway-remote` is affected.
- `scripts/src/lib/version-config.json` changes.

### `sdk-e2e` runs when either condition is true:

- Nx marks `@canton-network/wallet-sdk` as affected (including dependency-impact via project graph).
- `docs-wallet-integration-guide-examples` is affected.
- `scripts/src/lib/version-config.json` changes.
