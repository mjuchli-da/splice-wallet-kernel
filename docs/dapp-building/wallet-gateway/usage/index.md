# Using the Wallet Gateway

You can use the Wallet Gateway in two ways:

- mainly through the **User UI** (Web UI) for end users
- or through the **User API** (for automation, custom UIs, or integration with your own systems).

The **dApp API** is used by your dApp via the dApp SDK when users connect their wallet. See the [dApp SDK](../../dapp-sdk/index.md) for more details.

This section describes typical workflows, the User UI, session handling, and when to use which interface.

## User UI

The Wallet Gateway serves a **Web UI** at the Gateway root URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3030`). Users manage wallets, approve transactions, and adjust settings there.

**Main pages:**

- **Login** (`/login`): Choose a network and identity provider (IDP), then sign in (OAuth redirect or self-signed). Unauthenticated users are redirected here when they need to log in.

- **Wallets** (`/wallets`): List wallets, create new wallets (choose network, signing provider, party id), set the primary wallet, and remove wallets. This is the default landing page after login.

- **Transactions** (`/transactions`): List transactions. View status and details for prepared, signed, and executed transactions.

- **Approve** (`/approve`): Shown when a dApp requests a transaction (e.g. via `prepareExecute`). The user reviews the transaction and signs or rejects it. The dApp is notified of the result.

- **Settings** (`/settings`): Manage networks and identity providers (add, edit, remove), view sessions, and see Gateway version info.

- **Callback** (`/callback`): Used internally for OAuth redirects after login. Users are redirected back to the intended page (e.g. `/wallets`) or to the dApp.

Users **log out** via the layout logout control. Logout calls `removeSession`, clears local auth state, and redirects to `/login` (or closes the window if the UI was opened in a popup for approval).

## When to use which interface

- **User UI**: Best for end users. They log in, create and manage wallets, view transactions, and approve dApp requests. No code required.

- **User API**: Use when you need to:
    - Drive wallet setup or management from scripts or your own backend.
    - Build a custom wallet UI (e.g. embedded in your app) instead of the default User UI.
    - Automate session, network, IDP, or wallet operations.

- **dApp API** (via dApp SDK): Use from your **dApp** frontend. The SDK calls the dApp API to connect, list accounts, and prepare/execute transactions. Users approve via the Web UI or browser extension. See [dApp SDK usage](../../dapp-sdk/usage.md) and [APIs](../apis/index.md) for details.

## Typical flows

**1. User sets up a wallet**

- User opens the User UI and goes to **Login**.
- Selects network and IDP, completes login (e.g. OAuth).
- Lands on **Wallets**, creates a wallet (network, signing provider, party id), optionally sets it as primary.
- Can add networks or IDPs under **Settings** if needed.

**2. dApp connects and sends a transaction**

- Your dApp uses the dApp SDK: `connect()` → user is redirected to Gateway to log in if needed → `listAccounts()` → `prepareExecute(commands)`.
- User is sent to **Approve** to sign (or reject) the transaction.
- Once signed and executed, the dApp receives the result and can react to `onTxChanged`.

**3. User checks activity and manages wallets**

- User opens **Transactions** to list and inspect transactions.
- User opens **Wallets** to add wallets, change primary, or remove wallets.
- User opens **Settings** to manage networks, IDPs, or sessions.

**4. Automated wallet setup (User API)**

- Your script or backend calls `addSession()`, then your auth flow provides a JWT.
- Calls `listNetworks()` / `listIdps()`, then `createWallet()` with desired network and signing provider.
- Uses `listWallets()`, `sign()`, `execute()`, etc. as needed for your use case.
